ðŸ¦  Flu Tweet Analyzer

CIT 5940 â€“ Data Structures & Software Design
Author: Neysa Porter

What This Project Does

This program reads tweet data (either from a .json or .txt file), determines if a tweet is flu-related, matches it to a U.S. state based on its location, and counts how many flu-related tweets came from each state. It also logs all flu tweets with their corresponding state to a log file.

How It Works

The app is modular and organized into clearly defined classes:

Tweet Parsers â€“ Load tweets from JSON or TXT formats into objects.

State Reader â€“ Parses a CSV of state center coordinates.

Location Mapper â€“ Matches tweets to their nearest state based on latitude and longitude.

Flu Detector â€“ Detects flu-related tweets using regular expressions.

Analyzer â€“ Tallies up flu tweet counts per state.

Logger â€“ Writes matched flu tweets to a log file.

ConsolePrinter â€“ Outputs sorted flu counts to the terminal.

All functionality is controlled via the Main class using command-line arguments.

Sample Output
California: 1  
Florida: 1  
Louisiana: 2  
New Jersey: 3  
Pennsylvania: 2  


And the generated log file might look like this:

New Jersey	This flu season is the worst yet.  
Louisiana	Feeling awful... might be the #flu.  

How to Run It

From the command line:

# Run with JSON file:
java -cp "out;json-simple-1.1.1.jar" edu.upenn.cit594.Main flu_tweets.json states.csv log.txt

# Run with TXT file:
java -cp "out;json-simple-1.1.1.jar" edu.upenn.cit594.Main flu_tweets.txt states.csv log.txt


Or if youâ€™re using Codio, click:

âœ… Run BasicTests to test functionality

âœ… Run Your Program: JSON

âœ… Run Your Program: TEXT

Testing

The BasicTests.java file contains automated tests to verify:

Output formatting

Flu keyword detection

Proper state mapping

Log file structure and accuracy

Youâ€™ll see console output for each test run and can manually inspect generated logs.

Folder Structure

Your project should be organized like this:

Final Thoughts

This project gave me hands-on experience designing a clean, testable Java application from scratch using real-world data. I worked with file parsing, regex filtering, geographic calculations, and logging â€” all within a modular design that made the code easier to test and extend. Itâ€™s one of my favorite early projects for demonstrating core Java skills and software design principles.
